      <p>But you can call me Jen.</p>
      
      <p>I am a software engineer and engineering manager specializing in web and mobile application development. I currently serve as a Software Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.collectors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collectors</a>, where I lead a team of Java, React, and Flutter engineers responsible for building and maintaining the platform behind the <a href="https://www.psacard.com/info/psa-vault" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSA Vault</a>.</p>

      <p>Since 2024, I have also overseen the launch of several PSA Marketplace initiatives, including the <a href="https://www.psacard.com/info/consignment-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSA/eBay Marketplace</a>, <a href="https://www.psacard.com/info/psa-partner-offers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSA Partner Offers</a>, and <a href="https://powerpacks.gamestop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power Packs</a> (in partnership with GameStop).</p>

      <p>Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Lead at Wondery, where I helped launch the Wondery Mobile App, an exclusive listening experience for fans of the <a href="https://wondery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wondery Podcast Network</a>.</p>

      <p>In parallel with my engineering career, I spent more than fifteen years as a freelance opera singer based primarily in the greater Los Angeles area. I also joined the Metropolitan Opera Extra Chorus for multiple seasons, appearing in 30 performances at Lincoln Center in the Grammy-winning production of George Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess. I was honored to receive an official Grammy Certificate recognizing my contribution to the cast album, which won Best Opera Recording at the 2021 Grammy Awards.</p>

      <p>I am currently based in Orange County, California, not far from where I grew up. (No, we don't call it "The O.C." Yes, we do say "behind the Orange Curtain.") Outside of work, I enjoy taking advantage of Southern California’s coastal lifestyle and competing with friends on Duolingo to improve my rudimentary grasp of the French language. Merci de votre visite, et bonne journée!</p>
