I currently serve as a Software Engineering Manager at <a href=\"https://www.collectors.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collectors</a>, where I lead a team of Java, React, and Flutter engineers responsible for building and maintaining the platform behind the <a href=\"https://www.psacard.com/info/psa-vault\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PSA Vault</a>.</p>\n\n      <p>Since 2024, I have also overseen the launch of several PSA Marketplace initiatives, including the <a href=\"https://www.psacard.com/info/consignment-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PSA/eBay Marketplace</a>, <a href=\"https://www.psacard.com/info/psa-partner-offers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PSA Partner Offers</a>, and <a href=\"https://powerpacks.gamestop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Power Packs</a> (in partnership with GameStop).</p>\n\n      <p>Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Lead at Wondery, where I helped launch the Wondery Mobile App, an exclusive listening experience for fans of the <a href=\"https://wondery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wondery Podcast Network</a>.</p>\n\n      <p>In parallel with my engineering career, I spent more than fifteen years as a freelance opera singer based primarily in the greater Los Angeles area. I also joined the Metropolitan Opera Extra Chorus for multiple seasons, appearing in 30 performances at Lincoln Center in the Grammy-winning production of George Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess. I was honored to receive an official Grammy Certificate recognizing my contribution to the cast album, which won Best Opera Recording at the 2021 Grammy Awards.</p>\n\n      <p>I am currently based in Orange County, California, not far from where I grew up. (No, we don't call it \"The O.C.\" Yes, we do say \"behind the Orange Curtain.\") Outside of work, I enjoy taking advantage of Southern California’s coastal lifestyle and competing with friends on Duolingo to improve my rudimentary grasp of the French language.
